  "description": "Matrix Factorization is an iterative approach of SVD called Regularized SVD. It uses the gradient-descent method to estimate the resulting matrices. The obtained model will not be a true SVD of the rating-matrix, as the component matrices are no longer orthogonal, but tends to be more accurate at predicting unseen preferences than the standard SVD [Ekstrand et al. 2011].",
