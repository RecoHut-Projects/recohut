  "description": "SR stands for Sequential Rules. The SR method is a variation of MC and AR. It also takes the order of actions into account, but in a less restrictive manner. In contrast to the MC method, we create a rule when an item q appeared after an item p in a session even when other events happened between p and q. When assigning weights to the rules, we consider the number of elements appearing between p and q in the session.",
