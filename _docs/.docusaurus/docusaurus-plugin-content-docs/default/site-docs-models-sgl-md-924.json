  "description": "SGL is the latest baseline for top-k recommendations. It introduces self-supervised learning into the recommendation system based on the contrastive learning framework. It is implemented on LightGCN and uses a multitask approach that unites the contrastive loss and the BPR loss function. SGL mainly benefits from graph contrastive learning to reinforce user and item representations.",
